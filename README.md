# n-Queens-Solver
Collection of solvers for the n-Queens problem

**1. Depth first search (finds every solution)**

usage: $ python nQueensDepthFirstSearch *n*

where n is the number of queens on a n by n board

**2. Stochastic (might find a solution)**

usage: $ python nQueensLocalSearch *n j*

where n is the number of queens on a n by n board
and j the number of iterations
